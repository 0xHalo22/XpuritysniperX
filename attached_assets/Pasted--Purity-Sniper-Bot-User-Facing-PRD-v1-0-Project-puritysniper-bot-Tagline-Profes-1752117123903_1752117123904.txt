## 🎯 **What is Purity Sniper Bot?**

Purity Sniper Bot is a **professional-grade Telegram trading bot** that lets you execute lightning-fast ETH trades with **intentional, targeted sniping** capabilities. Unlike other bots that blindly snipe random pairs, Purity focuses on **precision trading** - you choose exactly which tokens to target.

**Key Philosophy**: Quality over quantity. Strategic sniping over spray-and-pray.

## 🚀 **Core Features**

### 💰 **ETH Trading Engine**

### 🎯 **Intentional Sniping System**
**The key differentiator**: You control what gets sniped.

```
