It looks like there could still be some problems causing the /start command to not function as expected. Here's a checklist of critical areas to verify in your index.js based on the changes you made and common pitfalls:

Logger Functionality: Ensure that the logger is indeed defined at the top and that it's being utilized correctly in the /start command:

bot.start(async (ctx) => {
  const userId = ctx.from.id.toString();
  logger.info(`New user started bot: ${userId}`);
  // Ensure this line is executed without error
  await showMainMenu(ctx);
});
Check for Errors in the Console: Look into the console output to see if any error messages are logged when you send the /start command. If there’s an unhandled promise rejection or an error in showMainMenu, that would prevent the bot from functioning correctly.

File Logging Structure: Ensure that the setupFileLogging() function actually executes during bot initialization to properly manage directory creation and class file logging.

User ID Retrieval: Ensure that the userId isn't encountering issues when the bot retrieves it from ctx.from.id. This might not throw an error but still return an undefined userId, leading to logging failures.

Database Initialization: Confirm that the database initialization was successful by checking the logs from your catch block:

// Initialize database
try {
  await initialize();
  console.log('✅ Database initialized');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('⚠️ Database initialization failed:', error.message);
}
Command Registration: Make sure that the bot commands are registered correctly:

await bot.telegram.setMyCommands([
  { command: 'start', description: 'Start the bot' },
  { command: 'help', description: 'Get help' }
]);
If all these areas are confirmed to be working, try deploying your bot again. Here’s the modified part of your index.js for clarity:

// Start command
bot.start(async (ctx) => {
   const userId = ctx.from.id.toString();
   logger.info(`New user started bot: ${userId}`); // Make sure this line logs correctly
   await showMainMenu(ctx); // Ensure showMainMenu doesn't have hidden errors
});
// Ensure this function has proper error handling
async function showMainMenu(ctx) {
   const keyboard = [
     [
       { text: '○ ETH', callback_data: 'chain_eth' },
       { text: '○ SOL', callback_data: 'chain_sol' }
     ],
     [
       { text: '○ Statistics', callback_data: 'statistics' },
       { text: '○ Settings', callback_data: 'settings' }
     ]
   ];
   const message = `❕ WELCOME BACK @ PURITY SNIPER BOT - 1.0 - A Pure Sniping Experience. 
   You are here: 🕊️HOME
   www.puritysniperbot.com`;
   try {
     await ctx.editMessageText(message, {
       reply_markup: { inline_keyboard: keyboard },
       parse_mode: 'Markdown'
     });
   } catch (error) {
     await ctx.reply(message, { reply_markup: { inline_keyboard: keyboard } });
     logger.error('Failed to edit message text:', error.message);
   }
}
This should help identify the issues preventing the bot from responding to the /start command. After making these adjustments, restart your bot and test again.
